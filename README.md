# HANNA - a glitched adventure

A platformer prototype made in scope of Cyberpunk jam 2019 https://itch.io/jam/cyberpunk-jam-2019

Hanna lives in virtual reality 24/7. But after hardware failure she appears in a game and tries to escape it.

Playing with headphones is very recommended!

Use arrows to navigate and jump.

Bottles are used as health (after standing on colourful platforms you lose a life of same color). You die after loosing bottles to 0/0.

This is just a small prototype now, I will add more platforms and features until cyberpunk jam 2019 submission deadline.
Feel free to give a feedback - I will really appreciate it!
